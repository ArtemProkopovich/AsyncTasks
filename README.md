# AsyncTasks
It is easy to solve this task using NET 4.5 and new async-await feature. In this case please add "async" keyword 
to any task method you found it reasonable. It is also possible to solve these tasks using NET 4.0 but it is a 
bit more complex and sophisticated.

NOTE:
1.	Use can see the debug information during test if Ã®pen Output window select output from "Debug". Hope it 
	helps you understand the request-response flow. It works in Debug mode only.

2.	Please check the performance of GetUrlContent against GetUrlContentAsync
